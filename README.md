# Pokemon Bike Theme Project

This project aims to create a device that plays the Pokemon bike theme song when the user starts pedaling their bike. The device will be attached to the bike and use a sensor to detect when the bike is in motion.

## Features

1. Attachable to a bike
2. Detects pedaling motion using a sensor
3. Plays the Pokemon bike theme song while pedaling
4. Stops playing when pedaling stops
5. Powered by a battery
6. Adjustable volume control
7. Weather-resistant design

## Components

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Audio output (e.g., speaker or buzzer)
- Sensor for detecting pedaling (e.g., hall effect sensor, reed switch, or accelerometer)
- Battery and power management system
- Enclosure for weather resistance

## Getting Started

1. Set up your Arduino development environment by following the instructions on the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
2. Assemble the required components.
3. Connect the components according to the provided schematics.
4. Load the provided source code onto the Arduino.
5. Attach the device to your bike and test the functionality.
